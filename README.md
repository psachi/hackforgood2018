# We are ServUT

Our purpose is to create a space where organizations can come together and provide solutions to uncommon needs.

## The Issue
### Non-profits are in need of human capital and student organizations can't easily find volunteering opportunities

Student organizations have to go through many layers of effort to find relevant ways to significantly impact their communities. Because of this friction, student groups prefer to volunteer with existing partnerships instead of looking for new ones, creating positive feedback loops. This leaves other nonprofits in greater need.

## Our Solution
### Create a dynamic service marketplace where student organizations and nonprofit organizations can connect

This platform acts as a marketplace between student organizations and community services. Volunteer organizations can directly advertise their needs so student organizations can most efficiently deploy their resources. This allows student groups to help the nonprofits that have the most unmet need.

## Our Progress
### Finding a Need, Initial Concept, and Overcoming Technical Challenges
With so many potential ways to help, how could our team best help the community as novices in technology? After talking with the Texas Ramp Project, we discovered that there was a large unmet need for the mobility-impaired community in Travis County. This backlog could easily be solved if more student organizations knew about the Texas Ramp Project. 

We then realized that if Texas Ramp Project had this need, other nonprofit organizations likely do too. By creating a social marketplace where nonprofits could post their service needs for student organizations to fill, the needs of these underserved communities could be met more efficiently.

Our MVP was to aggregate student organization data into one easy-to-access page so nonprofits could easily contact them. By using the Selenium package in Python, we worked on webscraping the names and contact information of all student organizations at UT Austin through the [Hornslink](https://utexas.campuslabs.com/engage/) database.
