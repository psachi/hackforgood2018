# We are ServUT

Our purpose is to create a space where organizations can come together and provide solutions to uncommon needs.

## The Issue
### Non-profits are in need of human capital and student organizations can't easily find volunteering opportunities
This platform acts as a marketplace between student organizations and community services. Volunteer organizations can directly advertise their needs so student organizations can best deploy their resources.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/psachi/hackforgood2018/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
